    <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
    <p>
      I was born in Seattle, WA, in 1986. I graduated Highschool in 2004 and
        promptly went to the Conservatory of Recording Arts and Sciences where I
        studied audio engineering. I then moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where
        I ran a recording studio. I then moved to NYC to work at the illustrious
        Electric Lady Studios. I then moved back to Seattle in 2009 to pursue my
        personal music career. I then joined codefellows in 2016 to learn code.
